## IWS Algo
For N iterations:
1. Semi-randomly generate a schedule of X Sunday bands that adheres to the following conditions:
* Members are not assigned if date is blacked out
* Members are assigned to serve only within their primary or secondary role(s)
* Each band must have one lead (vocalist)
* Each band has no more than 2 leads (vocalist)
* Each band must have one lead rhythm instrument (see 'Possible Lead Rhythm Roles')
* Each band has no more than one of each: 
  * lead keyboardist, rhythm keyboardist, drummer, percussionist, bassist

2. Score set of Sunday bands as follows: 
* +3 for each sunday band that is complete (contains leader, lead rhythm instrument, bass, keys, drums)
* +2 if low variability of utilization across all ministry members (goal is for close to uniform utilization)
* +2 for each pair of consecutive Sundays that do not have carryover members (check with moving window)
* +2 for each set of 3 consecutive Sundays that do not have carryover members (check with moving window)
* +2 for each sunday band that has two leads
* +2 for each sunday band that has a secondary vocalist
* +2 for each sunday band that has a lead electric guitarist
* +1 for each sunday band that that has a second keyboardist
* +1 for each sunday band that has a percussionist
* +1 for each member that serves in their secondary role at least once per term and no more than 50% of their Sundays

3. Output top 3 schedules (+ supporting metrics) for human evaluation


## Future Features
* Integrate into web service for more automation (pull directly from mongo)
* Less bruteforcey algorithm to reduce runtime
